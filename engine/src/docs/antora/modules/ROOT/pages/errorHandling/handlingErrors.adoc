= Handling errors
:page-pagination:

Throughout the whole HTML transformation process a lot can go wrong.
Here's a list of all exceptional scenarios together with information how to handle them.

|===
|Scenario|Exception type|How to handle

|Input HTML URL is invalid.
|PageRepositoryException
|Either `markuply.http.repository.urlPrefix` value is incorrect or the path parameter provided to a page processor.

|Input HTML host is unknown.
|UnknownHostException
|Either change the `markuply.http.repository.urlPrefix` value or make the target host reachable.

|Input HTML response code is not 200.
|
|An expected situation. Such cases will be handled just like 200 OK. The response code will be propagated to the client.

|Input HTML is not valid.
|
|Jsoup used underneath will handle any input HTML. The end result however might not be what you expect.

|Input HTML components could not be parsed. Either all child elements of data-markuply-component are marked with data-markuply-section or none of them.
|TemplateParserException
|Fix the input HTML.

|Component defined in data-markuply-component attribute is not registered.

|Component definition method has more than 3 arguments.

|Change component ID of one of offending components through the `Markuply` annotation.

|Component definition method contains an unsupported parameter.

|ArgumentResolutionException
|Make sure the `data-props` value is valid.

|Component definition context parameter cannot be resolved: `@Context UnknownType parameter`.

|JavascriptRendererException
|Make sure the script always returns a value that can be transformed to String.
